gMeasures v0.7
(C)2007 Paul Schuurmans


Introduction
============
gMeasures is a simple utility to convert weights and measures.  It can also 
convert Celsius / Fahrenheit temperatures.


Installation
============
The configure script has been omitted from this package due to its size 
and the fact that it doesn't work on all systems.  Instead, you run an 
autogen script which creates the configure script.  If you need to pass 
any parameters to the configure script, you can do so on the autogen.sh 
line.  Other than that, installation is pretty much the same as usual:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make
  make install


Using gMeasures
===============

To calculate weights and measures:
----------------------------------
1. Enter the amount in the first entry field (top left) and select the unit to 
convert in the first dropdown listbox.
2. In the second dropdown listbox, select the unit to convert to.

To edit an existing conversion:
-------------------------------
1. Use the dropdown listboxes to select the conversion.
2. Press the [Edit/Add] button.
3. Edit the "Equals" field.
4. Press the [OK] button.

To add a new conversion:
------------------------
1. Press the [Edit/Add] button.
2. Edit any or all of the fields as necessary.  Note: if you edit only the 
"Equals" field, it counts as an edit (i.e., no new conversion is added).
3. Press the [OK] button.

To delete a conversion:
-----------------------
Note: Read "The Edit/Add Dialog" below before doing this for the first time.
1. Use the dropdown listboxes to select the conversion.
2. Press the [Edit/Add] button.
3. Press the [Delete] button.

To calculate temperatures:
--------------------------
1. Enter the amount of degrees in either the Celsius or Fahrenheit entry field.


The Edit/Add Dialog
===================
When you press the [OK] or [Delete] button, gMeasures will automatically 
write the current configuration to a file named .gmeasures.cfg in your home 
directory.  Note that there is no confirmation after pressing either of these 
buttons.  You can revert back to the original 101 built-in conversions by 
deleting the .gmeasures.cfg file, but that won't restore any of your own 
conversions that you've added or edited.  So please be careful, especially 
before pressing the [Delete] button.


Locales
=======
By default, gMeasures uses the "C" locale.  If your locale uses a comma instead 
of a decimal point, and you want a localized version of this program, here are 
the steps to take:

1. In the main.c file, go to main() and uncomment the gtk_set_locale() line.
2. Also in the main.c file, go to AppReadWriteConfig() and replace the decimal 
points in the defs array with commas.
3. Recompile the program.


Known Quirks
============
- Limited accuracy.  Decimal fractions exceeding 5 digits may or may not be 
accurate.
