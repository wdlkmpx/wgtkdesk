Grsync Readme
=============

Fork of Piero Orsoni's GRSYNC (info@opbyte.it / http://www.opbyte.it/grsync/)

Grsync is a rsync GUI (Graphical User Interface). Rsync is the well-known
and powerful command line directory and file synchronization tool. Grsync
makes use of the GTK libraries and is released under the GPL license, so it
is opensource. It doesn't need the gnome libraries to run, but can of course
run under gnome, kde or unity pretty fine. It can be effectively used to
synchronize local directories and it supports remote targets as well (even
though it doesn't support browsing the remote folder).
Sample uses of grsync include:
synchronize a music collection with removable devices, backup personal files
to a networked drive, replication of a partition to another one, mirroring
of files, etc.

	* Most commonly used rsync options available, additional options may be
		specified by command line switches
	* Saves multiple settings with customized names (no limit on number of
		"sessions")
	* Session sets can be created: run multiple sessions at once!
	* Can do simulation or normal execution
	* Captures and prints rsync output nicely on a own window and log to a
		file (remember to clean it periodically or setup automatic log rotation)
	* Parses rsync output to display progress bars and other information
	* Highlights errors and show them on a separate window, for better and
		faster control over rsync runs

	* Can run custom commands before (and stop in case of failure) and after
		rsync

		people!
	* Can minimize to system tray (status icon), when supported
	* Can run specific sessions with superuser privileges
	* Rsync backup made easy!
	* Configuration is an easily readable .ini file, which you can copy to

	* Supports the Unity framework for progress display and notification
	* Needs rsync installed on the system (command line tool only, no need for
		server-side daemon) and GTK
	* Available for free and with sources!
